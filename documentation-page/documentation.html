            What is PyScript?
          </header>
          <p>
            Developed by the team from Anaconda including Peter Wang, Fabio
            Pliger, and Philipp Rudiger, PyScript is, as Peter mentioned in
            his talk, “a system for interleaving Python in HTML (like PHP)".
          </p>
          <p>
            This means you can write and run Python code in HTML, call
            Javascript libraries in PyScript, and do all your web development
            in Python. Sounds amazing!
          </p>

          <p>
            The most obvious thing is that with PyScript, we can now write
            Python (and potentially other languages) in HTML and build web
            applications. PyScript makes the power of Python accessible to a
            far greater audience of front-end developers and creators.
          </p>
          <p>
            With PyScript, we no longer need to worry about deployment.
            PyScript provides the “architectural shift beyond the cloud.”
            Everything will happen in your web browser. As data scientists, we
            can share our dashboards and our models in an html file, which
            will run code whenever others open the file in a web browser.

            PyScript is currently built on Pyodide, which is a “port of
            CPython to WebAssembly/Emscripten.” PyScript supports writing and
            running Python code in a browser, and it will provide support for
            other languages in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fundamental technology that makes it possible to write
            websites in Python is WebAssembly. When WebAssembly was originally
            developed, web browsers only supported Javascript.

            The alpha release of PyScript can be found on pyscript.net. The
            code is available at https://github.com/pyscript. Follow these
            instructions to give it a try. PyScript lets you write Python in
            html using the following three main components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              py-env defines the Python packages needed to run your Python
              code.
            </li>
            <li>
              py-script is where you write your Python code that gets executed
              within the web page
            </li>
            <li>
              py-repl creates a REPL (read-eval-print loop) component that
              evaluates the code users enter and displays the results.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <subheader>Hello World example</subheader>
          <pre>
            <code>
&lt;py-script&gt;
"Hello World"
&lt;/py-script&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>or, alternatively, pass the source file directly</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
&lt;py-script 
src="/my_own_file.py"&gt; 
&lt;/py-script&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <subheader>py-env example</subheader>
          <p>
            Here is an example on how we can define our Python environment in
            an HTML using py-env. In this example, we load the packages bokeh,
            numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn into our environment.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
&lt;py-env&gt;
- bokeh
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
&lt;/py-env&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <subheader>py-script example</subheader>
          <p>
            This example demonstrates a Panel dashboard with streaming data.
            As you can see in the code, we are able to write our familiar
            Python code in py-script like we normally do in a Python file. If
            you do not like to write your Python code directly under
            py-script, you can also use a Python file as the source code like
            this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
&lt;py-script 
src="/python-file.py"&gt; 
&lt;/py-script&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <subheader>Pandas example</subheader>
          <pre>
            <code>
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])
s
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            You can find many examples on the PyScript Github page, including
            a D3 visualization and a Mario game with computer vision.

          <p>
            PyScript brings Python to the browser. I’m very excited about this
            new innovation and can’t wait to see how it unfolds in the
            community.
          </p>
          <p>Stay tuned for many great new features coming soon!</p>
