      <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
      <p>Pasteur was born in Dole, France, the middle child of five in a family that had for generations been leather tanners. Young Pasteur's gifts seemed to be more artistic than academic until near the end of his years in secondary school. Spurred by his mentors' encouragement, he undertook rigorous studies to compensate for his academic shortcomings in order to prepare for the Ecole Normale Superieure, the famous teachers' college in Paris. He earned his master's degree there in 1845 and his doctorate in 1847.</p>
      <h3>Study of Optical Activity</h3>
      <p>While waiting for an appropriate appointment Pasteur continued to work as a laboratory assistant at the Ecole Normale. There he made further progress on the research he had begun for his doctoral dissertation-investigating the ability of certain crystals or solutions to rotate plane-polarized light clockwise or counterclockwise, that is, to exhibit "optical activity." He was able to show that in many cases this activity related to the shape of the crystals of a compound. He also reasoned that there was some special internal arrangement to the molecules of such a compound that twisted the light-an "asymmetric" arrangement. This hypothesis holds an important place in the early history of structural chemistry-the field of chemistry that studies the three-dimensional characteristics of molecules.</p>
      <h3>Fermentation and Pasteurization</h3>
      <p>Pasteur secured his academic credentials with scientific papers on this and related research and was then appointed in 1848 to the faculty of sciences in Strasbourg and in 1854 to the faculty in Lille. There he launched his studies on fermentation. Pasteur sided with the minority view among his contemporaries that each type of fermentation is carried out by a living microorganism. At the time the majority believed that fermentation was spontaneously generated by a series of chemical reactions in which enzymes-themselves not yet securely identified with life-played a critical role.</p>
      <h3>Germ Theory</h3>
      <p>At the same time Pasteur began his fermentation studies, he adopted a related view on the cause of diseases. He and a minority of other scientists believed that diseases arose from the activities of microorganisms-germ theory. Opponents believed that diseases, particularly major killer diseases, arose in the first instance from a weakness or imbalance in the internal state and quality of the afflicted individual. In an early foray into the causes of particular diseases, in the 1860s, Pasteur was able to determine the cause of the devastating blight that had befallen the silkworms that were the basis for France's then-important silk industry. Surprisingly, he found that the guilty parties were two microorganisms rather than one.</p>
